# Research and Waves Website Repository

Research and Waves is an artistic research project and collective that explores the space between curatorial practice and artistic methodology. We aim to draw enriching connections and create a conversation between art, music, technology and society through experimental events and presentation formats in the context of art and culture.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
